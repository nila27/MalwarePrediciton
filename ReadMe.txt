before execute lightgbm.py, you must download train.csv in https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data

and must be in the same path as lightgbm.py


The dataset and extraction method used in Feature_List.xlsx are summarized.


You will often see Korean language in the Excel file or code. I will fix this later.
